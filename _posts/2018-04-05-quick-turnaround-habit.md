title: My Quick Turnaround Habit

I work with people. A lot of people. Some are an absolute pleasure to work with, others... not so much. 

So Iâ€™ve developed a habit that helps me recover quickly. 

Following a terrible experience with a coworker, I go to one that I enjoy working with and tell them how much I enjoy working with them and why.

This simple act results in two things:
1. I quickly shake off any frustration or angst leftover from what happened earlier. 
2. My coworkers get unsolicited and positive reinforcement for the work that they do. 

If my positive feedback goes towards a coworker who was with me enduring that experience, it also signals to them what my beliefs are on acceptable and non-acceptable behavior. 


Good vibes all around.
