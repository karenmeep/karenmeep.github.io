<p>I love designing and building infrastructure/platform products. I enjoy the challenge of reconciling developer experience and operations, as well as the end users goal and experience. 
</p>
<p>
I have vast experience working on multidisciplinary projects. I'm an experienced developer, product architect, manager and mentor. I believe in and practice leadership without authority, I help people understand both the business context and the underlying architectural landscape.
