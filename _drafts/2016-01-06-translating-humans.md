A huge part of my life is spent translating.

My network is made up of engineers, a community widely known for its autistic tendencies. Most of them learn how to systemize, as opposed to empathize.

Systemizing involves identifying the laws that govern how a system works. Once you know the laws, you can control the system or predict its behavior. Empathizing, on the other hand, involves recognizing what another person may be feeling or thinking, and responding to those feelings with an appropriate emotion of one’s own.
